# lltiler
Tools for creating tilemaps from data on lat/lon grids.

**NOTE:** this project is still only a little scratch and might change. However it should be possible to create working tilemaps using the tools.

The basic idea is that all it needs to create a web tile map is a function which maps from latitude longitude coordinates to color values.
Have a look at `misc/test_lltiler.py` to get an idea how it should work.
